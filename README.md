## Description

Password Generator is a simple browser application that generates passwords based on user input. 

The motivation for this project was to allow users to generate a random password based on their preferences regarding password length and whether or not they'd like the password to include numbers, special characters, upper case characters and lower case characters. Having different passwords for all your accounts online is crucial for protecting yourself from cyber attacks like credential stuffing. Password Generator makes it easy to have strong and unique passwords! 

  Creating this website helped me learn about: 
  * Javascript
  * Functions
  * For Loops
  * If statements
